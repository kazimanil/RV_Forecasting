## Warning
R codes that has been utilized by [Eren](https://github.com/kazimanil) uses the .RProfile in the directory. This .RProfile loads some libraries and changes some default settings beforehand. If one wishes to use the same setting to get the same result, then s/he must copy the .RProfile in the his/her default R directory (Documents for me).
